# FDS-SUBMISSION

Repository for the Fundamentals of Data Science Kaggle competition.

## Contents

- `pipeline.py`: main code for data loading, feature engineering, model training and prediction.
- `generate_submissions.py`: script that generates the three final submission files for Kaggle.

## Final submissions

The final leaderboard submissions are based on three models:

1. Model 1: [descrizione breve, es. "baseline model"]
2. Model 2: [descrizione breve]
3. Model 3: [descrizione breve, es. "ensemble of model 1 and 2"]

## How to reproduce

On Kaggle, the final notebook:

1. Clones this repository.
2. Uses `pipeline.py` to train the models and generate predictions.
3. Runs `generate_submissions.py` to produce three CSV files ready for submission.
